### Recommended Setup

For best results, follow these steps:

   - In CMSMS admin, create a new page (e.g., "Server Info" or "PHP Diagnostics")
2. **Assign a Block Template**

   - Choose a minimal "block" template (no header/footer)
   - This prevents HTML conflicts with phpinfo's full HTML output
3. **Add the Tag**

   - In the page content, add: `{phpinfo}`
4. **Set Page Properties**

   - Mark the page as "hidden" or restrict it in your navigation
   - Optionally set "Show in Menu" to "No"
5. **Access the Page**

   - Visit the page as an administrator
   - You'll see the complete PHP information display

- ‚úÖ PHP version and build information

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Access Denied Error

**Problem:** Red error message saying "Access Denied: Administrator privileges required"

**Solution:**

- Ensure you're logged in as an administrator
- Verify your user account has "Manage Settings" permission
- Check in: Extensions ‚Üí User Management ‚Üí Groups

### Blank or No Output

**Problem:** Page shows nothing or is blank

**Solution:**

- Verify the plugin file is correctly uploaded to the `plugins/` directory
- Check file permissions (should be 644)
- Look for PHP errors in your server error log
- Ensure phpinfo() function is not disabled in php.ini (check `disable_functions` directive)

### HTML Layout Conflicts

**Problem:** Page layout breaks or looks strange

**Solution:**

- Use a "block" template without header/footer
- Create a dedicated page just for phpinfo display
- The phpinfo() function outputs a complete HTML document, which conflicts with most site templates

### CyberPanel / OpenLiteSpeed Specific

**Problem:** Function not working on CyberPanel/OpenLiteSpeed

**Solution:**

- Verify PHP is running in LSAPI mode
- Check that phpinfo() is not disabled in your PHP configuration
- Test with a simple PHP file first to ensure phpinfo() works on your server
